<h1>PolyML JEdit Plugin</h1>

<h2>About</h2>

<p>
The JEdit PolyML Plugin provides <a href="http://www.jedit.org/">JEdit</a>
with features for editing, compiling, and examining SML Code.
&nbsp;It requires that <a href="http://www.polyml.org/">PolyML</a>
5.3 or later is installed. The plugin and PolyML IDE mode has been
developed and is being
supported by <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ldixon/">Lucas
Dixon</a> and David Matthews. The project is open-source, under
the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU
Lesser General Public License</a>, and is hosted by sourceforge
at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/polyml/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/polyml/</a>
</p>

<h2>Download, Install and Setup</h2>

<h3>Download and Dependencies</h3>

<p>The plugin is a self-contained jar file, but assumes you have
installed
<a href="http://www.jedit.org/">jEdit</a> (tested on version 4.3) as
well as <a href="http://www.polyml.org/">PolyML</a> (tested with
version 5.3). Currently, it also uses the
jEdit <a href="http://plugins.jedit.org/plugins/?ErrorList">ErrorList
plugin</a>, so you will need to install that first. This can be done
easily using the Plugin Manager within jEdit.

<h3>Installation</h3>
To install the PolyML plugin, you need to place it into
either your jEdit's "<code>jars</code>" subdirectory of its
install directory, or your user account's jEdit "<code>jars</code>"
subdirectory - in unix systems this is "<code>.jedit/jars</code>".
When you then startup jEdit you should have a new menu item within
the&nbsp;<code>Plugins</code> menu called&nbsp;<code>PolyML-Plugin</code>.

<h3>Setup</h3>
Once you have installed the plugin, feedback is presented through the
<a href="http://plugins.jedit.org/plugins/?ErrorList">error list
plugin</a>. Select <code>error list</code> from
the <code>ErrorList</code> submenu of the <code>Plugins</code> menu to
bring up the error list panel which will give feedback. I normally
dock this at the bottom of the editing window. It can also be useful
to bind the PolyML jedit plugin commands, such as process buffer in
ML, to key combination. You can do this from the <code>Global
Options...</code> submenu of the <code>Utilities</code> menu. Then
select <code>PolyML-Plugin</code> from the <code>Edit Shortcuts</code>
pop-up menu to see and edit only the shortcuts for this plugin.

<h2>Using the Plugin</h2>

There are two ways to use the Plugin: 

<ul>
<li><b>a Shell buffer</b>: select new shell buffer from PolyML-Plugin
(sub)menu. This creates a new buffer which, whenever you run the
"Process Buffer in PolyML" command, will send all output after the
prompt (or vertical red bar if the prompt have been deleted), to ML.
</li>

<li><b>the IDE mode</b>: open the root file of your project (one which
has a <code>use</code> for each other file). The run the <code>Process
Buffer in PolyML</code> command. Error will be listed in the error list
window/panel. If error is in a used file, you get will get a not-very
informative error, but it will be at the line of
the <code>use</code>. Open up that file and then run the <code>Process
buffer in PolyML</code> command again. Now you will see the errors in
the error list.
<br><br>
The IDE mode also lets you inspect types of sub-expressions (for files
that have been parsed successfully, but which fail at
type-checking). Select the sub-expression you want to know the type
of, and then use the command <code>Get Type at Cursor/Selection</code>. The type
is printed as a warning in the Error list window/panel.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Shell buffer</h3>

<p>
The shell buffer gives you a terminal within a buffer much like emacs
shell mode. Within this buffer there is a prompt and all text after the
prompt is considered as input and can be sent to the underlying
(PolyML) process. All output from the underlying PolyML process is
printed at the start of the shell-prompt. You have all the normal
editing tools for that buffer.&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<h3>PolyML IDE protocol</h3>

<p>The PolyML Plugin provide a method to interact with PolyML's IDE
protocol. This allows:<br>

</p>

<ul>

  <li>the parsing/type-checking/evaluation of buffers by ML.  Error
messages and warnings displayed in the ErrorList panel, provided by
the ErrorList plugin;</li>

  <li>get the type of a value;</li>

  <li>get the location where a value is declared, the structure
in
which it is defined, and if it has been introduced by an open, you can
also get the location of the open statement;</li>

  <li>the user can move around the parse-tree.</li>

</ul>

<p>These functions are all available from the PolyML-Plugin
sub-menu of
the Plugins menu. You can assign the functions useful shortcuts from
jEdit's Global Options (in the Utilities menu).
</p>

<h3>Project IDE structure and heaps</h3>

<p>
The jEdit plugin compiles a small ML file the first time the IDE
protocol is started (see ide.sml, inside the project jar file). This
defines a structure&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">IDE</span>,
which as well as being at the top level, also exists in the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PolyML</span>
structure. This also re-defines the use function to do a little project
management. <br>

<br>

Whenever a new ML file is run, jEdit searches for a&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">.polysave</span>
in the current path and then in any parent path. If jEdit finds the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">.polysave</span>directory,
then the location of the&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">.polysave</span>
directory is considered to be the project directory. Whenever a <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">use</span>
statement is made in ML and the file being used is within the project
directory, a saved heap file is stored in the&nbsp; <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">.polysave</span>
directory. Whenever a file is checked, it is done so from the last
saved heap file, if there is one. If there is no project directory, a
new&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">.polysave</span>
is created in location of the run ML file. If there is a project
directory, but no heap file, ML uses the IDE heap file as the starting
heap.<br>

<br>

You can delete the&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">.polysave</span>
directory to reset or change the project directory. <br>

</p>

<h4>Details of the Project IDE structure</h4>

<p>
The old use function is still available as <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">IDE.basicUse</span><code></code>.
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"></span><br>

<br>

There are two important variables in the IDE structure for project
management: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">IDE.projectDirRef
: string ref</span><br>

This holds a string for the current project directory.&nbsp; <br>

<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"><br>

IDE.saveSubDirRef : string ref</span><br>

<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"></span>This
holds a string that identifies the save directory, where saved project
heap files are places and is a relative path name from
the&nbsp;project directory. By default this is set to&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">".polysave"</span>.
Note that these references are maintained by onLoad so will not be
changed by subsiquent loading of heaps. <br>

<br>

There is also a function&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">setProjectDir</span>
takes a string a sets the&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">projectDirRef</span>
as well as the changing current working directory for ML to the project
directory. <br>

<br>

The idea is that within a project's directory there is a saved state
directory which holds the state right before each file is used. This
way a file can be re-run and checked for errors quickly. We avoid
having to start from the very first ML file each time.<br>

<br>

The modified <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">use</span>
function saves a copy of the current ML state within the save
subdirectory before a file is used. For example is working in a project
which has a&nbsp; directory <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">/home/username/p
</span>and writing: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">use
"b/c.ML";<br>

<br>

</span>will create a saves state:&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">/home/username/p/.polysave/b/c.ML.save</span>
which hold the PolyML state just before the use statement was called.
