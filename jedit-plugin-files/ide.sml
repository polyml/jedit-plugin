    This is a "use" function that the IDE calls in the prelude before a build.
    It takes a directory name and returns a "use"
    function that saves the state and dependencies in ".save" and ".deps" files
    within that directory.
    
    It is called by over-riding use e.g.
      val use = IDE.projectUse ".polysave" "/home/ldixon/myproject"
    to define a version of "use" for the rest of the compilation.
